**************************** Voyage ***************************************


goal 
- escape by building a super computer capable of sending u to a differrent device



obstacles 
- heat waves ( increases the heat level )
- asteroids ( will destroy any machines the asteroid hits )
- viruses ( over heat up your computer and stops you from researching by attack your computer )
- time limit - 15(20?)min ( your planet will explode after a certain heat level is reached )



Edit mode/Land mode
- build different machines to create a super computer
- R to rotate object
- snapping grid
- left click to place 
- right click to edit



Computer screen
- research ( allows you to acsess new machines by researching them )
- storage ( shows the amount of energy you have )
- radar ( the radar shows the amount of asteroids that are going to hit you )
- heat level ( shows you the planet heat level but it isnt always accurate )
